Which type of visualisation would you choose if you wanted to show relationships between 3 numerical values and turn the horizontal axis into a logarithmic scale? The worksheet data would include grouped sets of values and you wanted to show patterns in large sets of data, for example by showing linear or non-linear trends, clusters, and outliers?
如果你想展示三个数字化的值之间的关系，并且将水平轴做为对数刻度，你会选择哪一种可视化对象？工作表数据包含己分组的集合，并且你希望在大数据量下展示，例如，显示线性或非线性趋势，簇和异常数据？
Scatter chart散点图
Bubble chart气泡图
Treemap树图
Pie chart饼图
----------------------------------------------
Bubble charts are a good choice when your data has 3 data series that each contain a set of values. Particularly to present financial data when you want different bubble sizes to visually emphasize specific values. Bubble charts are also great for use with quadrants.
气泡图是好的选择，当你的数据有三个数据系列，并且每个包含一系列数据。特别是展示金融数据，当你希望不同的气泡尺寸做为强调特别数值。气泡图还特别用于象限。

You want to create a DAX formula that automatically calculates the previous month number. So if the month was June then the formula would return 5. You have already created the DAX formula below:
你想创建一个dax函数，可以自动计算前一个月的数字。所以如果月是6月，函数返回5。你己经创建如下dax函数

Today Month = MONTH (Sales[Todays Date])

Which of the DAX formulas below would be the right choice next?

Previous Month = Sales[Today Month]-1
	Previous Month = PREVIOUSMONTH(Sales[Today Month])
	Previous Month = STARTOFMONTH(Sales[Today Month])-1
	Previous Month = IF (Sales[Today Month] =1, 12,Sales[Today Month]-1)

The internal finance team needs a new dashboard creating to show projected revenue for the coming years so they can adequately plan for future budgets. All of the data for this dashboard will come from SQL Server 2005 that is running on the company’s main SQL Server machine. The IT team has informed you that the SQL Server machine has many instances of SQL Server installed including 2005, 2008, 2012 and even 2016. If the server name was ACMESQL and the instance name provided by IT was SQL2005, what would you type into the Server name textbox when connecting through Power BI?
内部金融团队需要创建一个仪表盘，用于规划未来年度收入，这样他们可以适当计划未来预算。所有这个仪表盘上的数据，来自SqlServer2005，它运行在公司的SqlServer主机上。IT团队告知你，SqlServer主机有若干实例是SqlServer安装包括2005，2008，2012，甚至2016。如果服务器名是ACMESQL，并且实例名由IT提供做为SQL2005，那么当你通过PowerBi连接服务器时，你将在服务器名文本框中录入什么？

A sales analysis dashboard contains a model with several datasets. Two of the datasets are called DimCustomer and FactInternetSales. They are linked through model relationships, with each customer potentially having many sales.
一个销售分析仪表盘，包括一个模型有数个数据集。其中两个是 DimCustomer and FactInternetSales。他们通过模型关系连接起来，每个客户可能有多次销售
You need to write a DAX expression that will calculate the Total Revenue for each customer by using SUMX and the inherent relationship between the two tables. Which function below would be most appropriateto use inside of SUMX if you didn’t want to further filter the relationship?
你需要写一个dax表达式，可以计算每个客户全部收入使用sumx，并且两个表之间的内在关系。下面的函数中哪个是最合适的使用在sumx，如果你不想未来过滤这个关系？
